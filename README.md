JM-ExpressionEngine-Upload-Path-Updater
=======================================

This tool has been replaced by a proper ExpressionEngine module I built here: https://github.com/JamesMcFall/EE-Upload-Path-Updater

This is a simple tool I put together under a lot of time pressure while working on a large web project that was on half a dozen different environments around the world. As a result moving database copies from the master copy down to the other servers frequently made keeping the upload paths up to date in ExpressionEngine very tedious, so this sorted that out.

It's not pretty but it works!
